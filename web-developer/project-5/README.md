## Orinoco
This is the back end server for Project 5 of the Junior Web Developer path (https://github.com/OpenClassrooms-Student-Center/JWDP5)

### Prerequisites
You will need to have Node and `npm` installed locally on your machine.

### Installation
Clone this repo. From within the project folder, run `npm install`. You 
can then run the server with `node server`. 
The server should run on `localhost` with default port `3000`. If the
server runs on another port for any reason, this is printed to the
