### Expected deliverables
*A website including...*
1. A home page with the company logo, a space containing the 4 menus, a "coming soon" section and the "Legal" and "Contact us" sections.
2. 4 pages each containing the menu of a restaurant. When clicking on the menu on the home page, the user is redirected to the menu page.
3. Clicking on "Legal" opens a new page.
4. Clicking on "Contact us" will redirect the user to an e-mail address.
5. The header (containing the company logo) and the footer (containing "Legal information" and "Contact us") are present on all pages.
6. The footer must remain visible even when scrolling.
*Graphic effects...*
1. For each menu item, an animation that zooms in on the image should be integrated, with a fade effect (reducing the opacity) without making the initial frame bigger.
2. In the next section, suspension points should be progressively animated. They can either shake like when someone types a new message, or appear gradually.
3. The "contact" and "legal" buttons should wiggle.
4. The titles representing the categories of starters, main courses and desserts should be underlined from left to right on mouse-over.
